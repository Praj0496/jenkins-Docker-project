<H2>Multi-Stage Jenkins Pipelines with Unique Agents</H2>

Establish a Jenkins pipeline composed of multiple stages, with each stage executed on a distinct agent. This strategy is particularly beneficial when dealing with applications written in multiple languages or applications that have conflicting dependencies. 
It ensures isolation between stages and provides a robust setup for complex application deployment. This approach enhances the efficiency and reliability of the pipeline, making it a powerful tool for DevOps practices.
